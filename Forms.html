         <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. 
            Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, 
            plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
            Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change
            are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
            We are experts in climate and Earth science. While its role is not to set climate policy
            or prescribe particular responses or solutions to climate change, 
            its purview does include providing the robust scientific data needed to understand climate change 
            and evaluating the impact of efforts to combat it. We then makes this information available
            to the global community â€“ the public, policy- and decision-makers and scientific and planning agencies around the world.
